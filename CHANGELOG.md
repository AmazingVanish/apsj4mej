# RELEASE NOTES

## Version 1.3.0 - Toolbar and Font sizes

-   Remove the separators from the toolbar to prevent TinyMCE from truncating. This prevents the persistent display of the toolbar when closing the journal dialog (Thanks SecretSquirrel77)
-   Combined some toolbar icons into 3 groups so it doesn't require as much horizontal real estate yet provides more options:
    -   Format (bold italic underline strikethrough forecolor backcolor superscript subscript removeformat)
    -   Paragraph ('h1 h2 h3 bullist numlist alignleft aligncenter alignright indent outdent)
    -   Insert (link anchor image table hr template)
-   Set more reasonable default font sizes for the Stylish Text (Thanks weepingminotaur for the idea)
-   Colored the journal tabs and made the active tab stand out more
-   Added margin spacing around the block elements so they dispolay nicer when one right after another
